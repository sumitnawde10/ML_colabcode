##  Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Open the desired .ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells step-by-step to understand and experiment with the code.
You can add your Datasets Path as Per Your need.

Requirements
Most notebooks are run on Google Colab, so you don't need to install anything. If running locally, ensure you have:

Python 3.x

scikit-learn

pandas

matplotlib

numpy

tensorflow (for deep learning notebooks)
pip install -r requirements.txt
